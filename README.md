# Airbnb-Sentiment-Analysis
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of Airbnb reviews in New York City for the year 2023. 

The goal is to understand the overall sentiment of guestsâ€™ experiences and identify common themes in positive and negative feedback. The insights gained from this analysis are expected to help Airbnb hosts make more informed decision and enable the platform itself to improve the overall guest experience by addressing common issues and enhancing positive aspects.

For that purpose, the project is divided into two Notebooks:
- [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/maurodv09/Airbnb-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/data_cleaning.ipynb): Standard dataset cleaning, as well as Text Cleaning for each review.
- [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/maurodv09/Airbnb-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/sentiment_analysis.ipynb): Classification, Visualization and Conclusions.


## Dataset

The results of the reviews analyzed were stored in the analysis_data folder


## Limitations
